About:

For this project, I built an interactive fractal tree using the Swift programming language. I built a new "game" application using xCode, and then used the spritekit graphics to draw a fractal tree. Users can move the tree by dragging their finger along the screen. If they tap the "settings" button, they can change the angle and the depth of the tree.


Instructions: 

- You need xCode (I'm using version 7.3, but it should work on others)
- git clone https://github.com/tsammons/SwiftFractal.git
- open "fractal3.xcodeproj"
- build and run the project using the play button in upper right hand corner,
  the scene looks best if you choose iPhone 6s Plus as the simulation device
